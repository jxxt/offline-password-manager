## INTRODUCTION
* What is a Password Manager?
A password manager is a software program that helps users store and organize their passwords, and even include additional feature to generate strong and random passwords.

* Why a Password Manager is used?
A password manager is used to improve the security and convenience of managing online accounts. It helps the users to save their time as they don't have to remember multiple passwords and usernames for different sites.

## about this PROJECT

[offline-password-manager](https://github.com/jxxt/offline-password-manager) is an offline CLI app purely written in C++. It primarily uses `fstream` C++ library, along with other C++ libraries to use the root folder of `main.cpp` file as a 'database' to  store passwords in `.txt` formatted files. It uses an ecryption-decryption algorithm that helps to save passwords securely to their respectice `.txt` files.

## USAGE
* method 1 :-<br>
step 1: clone this repository into your system<br>
step 2: open the cloned repository folder in your desired 'file explorer'<br>
step 3: run `main.exe` file 
(this will open already compiled `main.cpp` file into the cmd/pws/bash) 

* method 2 :-<br>
step 1: set up C++ into your system (I prefer [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) method)<br>
step 2: clone this repository into your system<br>
step 3: open the cloned repository folder in VS Code<br>
step 4: open `main.cpp` file from side-bar of VS Code<br>
step 5: compile and run the opened  `main.cpp` using any code runner extension (I prefer [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danielpinto8zz6.c-cpp-compile-run))
